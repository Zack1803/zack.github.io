Premier League also known as English Premier League is a top tier soccer league in England where 20 teams compete for the title every year. The given dataset is a collection of the key data points of the Premier League 2019-20 season.

The following are the metadata details of the dataset:


The given dataset can help conduct a detailed performance analysis at the end of the season to help prepare for the upcoming season. The analysis on this dataset can not only help improve team performance but also can also help scout potential young players. The idea of data analysis in Soccer is relatively new and has a huge potential to disrupt the way the football clubs conduct their scouting and analysis.

The following are the potential applications of the Premier League 19/20 Dataset: 

  1. Player analysis
  2. Team analysis
  3. Smart Scouting
  4. Scores Prediction






As mentioned earlier, the concept of Sports Analytics is relatively new for the football industry. But over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the usage of analytics in soccer. The majority of the credit goes to the writer Micheal Lewis and his book “Moneyball: The art of winning an unfair game”. The book introduces the concept of Sports Analytics and how Oakland Athletics, a baseball team and its general manager Mr. Billy Beane along with Peter Brand used sports analytics techniques to conduct smart scouting of players. Using this strategy, Oakland Athletics secured a 20 games winning streak between August and September 2002.

The above dataset can help answer some of the most basic questions like:

  1. Who has scored the most number of goals?
  2. Who has made the most assists?
  3. Which player has the most number of red cards? 
  4. Which player has the most number of yellow cards?
  5. Which goalkeeper has kept the most number of clean sheets?

The dataset can also help answer some of the advanced questions question such as:

  1. Which player has overperformed on the basis of expected goals & assists?
  2. Which player has underperformed on the basis of expected goals & assists?
  3. Who has the best shot conversion rate in the league?
  4. What is the style of play of a particular team? ( This can be determined by examining the type of passes made by the team. For example: If a team has a lower percentage of possession and more long passes compared to short passes, then the likelihood of them playing on the counter attack is pretty high. Similarly, if a team has more ball possession and higher number of close range passes then it is likely that the team’s style of play is based on 3 P’s i.e, Possession, position and passing.

Sometimes, only numbers can be misleading and further in depth analysis would be needed to determine the root cause of it.
